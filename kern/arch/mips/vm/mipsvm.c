 * Dumb MIPS-only "VM system" that is intended to only be just barely
 * enough to struggle off the ground. You should replace all of this
 * code while doing the VM assignment. In fact, starting in that
 * assignment, this file is not included in your kernel!
 *
 * NOTE: it's been found over the years that students often begin on
 * the VM assignment by copying dumbvm.c and trying to improve it.
 * This is not recommended. dumbvm is (more or less intentionally) not
 * a good design reference. The first recommendation would be: do not
 * look at dumbvm at all. The second recommendation would be: if you
 * do, be sure to review it from the perspective of comparing it to
 * what a VM system is supposed to do, and understanding what corners
 * it's cutting (there are many) and why, and more importantly, how.
